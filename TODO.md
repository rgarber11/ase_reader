1. WRITE TESTS!!! (The LAB ⇿ RGB code is probably wrong.)
2. Create a CLI for the `ase_reader`, which can output in human-readable formats
3. Runtime check for [opencv-python](https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python/), and use that if it's available.
4. If possible, find some way to read .icc files to make RGB ⇿ CMYK conversions real. Otherwise (or possibly regardless), add some sort of warning to make sure people know what they're getting in to.
